# Artificial Neural Network Projects

This repository contains two projects that demonstrate the application of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) in solving both classification and regression problems. These projects are designed to help you understand the fundamentals of ANNs and how they can be applied to real-world datasets.

## Projects

### 1. Classification Project
This project focuses on solving a classification problem using an Artificial Neural Network. The goal is to classify data into predefined categories. The project includes data preprocessing, model building, training, and evaluation.

**Key Features:**
- Data preprocessing and normalization.
- Building a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) model.
- Training the model using backpropagation.
- Evaluating the model using metrics like accuracy, confusion matrix

### 2. Regression Project
This project demonstrates how to use an Artificial Neural Network for regression tasks. The objective is to predict continuous values based on input features. The project covers data preparation, model architecture, training, and performance evaluation.

**Key Features:**
- Data preprocessing and feature scaling.
- Designing a neural network for regression.
- Training the model using gradient descent.
- Evaluating the model using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE)
